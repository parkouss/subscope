# Quickstart

1. Install subscope

        pip install -U subscope

2. Start looking for subtitles

        subscope -l fr,en /path/to/my/movie1.avi /path/to/my/movie2.mkv

That's all! Each subtitle will be downloaded next to the corresponding
movie file.

You can learn more by looking at [command line tips] or [using a config file].
