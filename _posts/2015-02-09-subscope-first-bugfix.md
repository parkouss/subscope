Well, that wasn't long :) First bug has been found in *subscope*. It is
related to the [OpenSubtitles] source, and the bug was found by the
OpenSubtitles admin! Thanks to his report, the **1.0.1** release fixes:

- searching subtitles for big movies (movie size int overflow)
- non ascii communication with opensubtitles
