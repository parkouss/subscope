Hey! I'm happy to announce the first release of subscope!

This is already fully working. You can download subtitles in multiple
languages, there is an interactive mode and subtitles are found from two
sources: [TheSubDB] or [OpenSubtitles].

Give it a try !

[TheSubDB]:      http://thesubdb.com/
[OpenSubtitles]: http://www.opensubtitles.org
